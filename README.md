# i18next-php
A port of [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) in PHP. With a rest API. (coming soon \[tm\])

Code in this repository is largely based on the original code base in JavaScript, rewritten in PHP.

### Warning!

This version is still in early development stages, I'm advising against using it. As of now.
This project is something I'm working on between other work, as such the updates may appear spontanously.

It's extremely likely that things are broken as right now I'm simply porting over the 
JS code without testing it for compatibility with PHP.

### Todo

* Finish all components
* Prepare for composer use (it will not be a solid requirement)
* Port over tests
* Actually test it
* Add PHP-specific loading code for files, searching etc.
