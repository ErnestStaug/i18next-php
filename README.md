# i18next-php
An implementation of i18next more like the original, in PHP. With a rest API.

### Warning!

This version is still in early development stages, I'm advising against using it. Yet.
This project is something I'm working on between other work, as such the updates may appear spontanously.

It's extremely unlikely that things are broken as right now I'm simply porting over the 
JS code without testing it for compatibility with PHP.
